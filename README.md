Cannabis / Marijuana Facts
--------------------------
20 states in the US have legalized cannabis for medical purposes. Colorado and Washington state also permit recreational use of marijuana.

There are two very distinct groups of marijuana strains. One is cannabis; the other is hemp.

Cannabis is potent medicine courtesy of high amounts of CBD, medicinal terpenes, and flavonoids. It also contains varying amounts of THC. The higher the THC, the more pronounced its psychoactive effects
